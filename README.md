A catalogue of best practices for managing data

As a long-time end user of data (for dashboarding, analytics and machine learning), I've catalogued here a [list of data management inefficiencies that have repeatedly wasted a lot of my time](#common-struggles-as-a-data-consumer), and [a list of good practices for negating them](#data-warehouse-best-practices)

# Common Struggles as a Data Consumer

| Problem                                                    | Solution(s)
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------
| What do the fields in the data mean? How are they defined? | [Document every field](#document-every-field) 
|                                                            | [Each data field owned by a specific person](#each-data-field-owned-by-a-specific-person) 

# Data Warehouse Best Practices

| Good Practice                                        | Reason
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------
| <a data-should-be-in-at-least-3rd-normal-form>Data should be in at least 3rd normal form</a> |

# Security Principles

| Observability/monitoring |
| Incident response        |
| Defense in Depth         |
| Separation of Duties     |
| Data encryption          | In transit and at rest
| Least Privilege          | 
| Secure by Design         |
